### Display driver

1. Listing of VHDL code of the completed process `p_mux`. Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow VHDL guidelines:

```vhdl
    --------------------------------------------------------
    -- p_mux:
    -- A sequential process that implements a multiplexer for
    -- selecting data for a single digit, a decimal point,
    -- and switches the common anodes of each display.
    --------------------------------------------------------
    p_mux : process (clk) is
    begin

        if (rising_edge(clk)) then
            if (rst = '1') then
                sig_hex <= data0;
                dp      <= dp_vect(0);
                dig     <= "1110";
            else

            case sig_cnt_2bit is

            when "11" =>
                sig_hex <= data3;
                dp      <= dp_vect(3);
                dig     <= "0111";

            when "10" =>
                sig_hex <= data2;
                dp      <= dp_vect(2);
                dig     <= "1011";

            when "01" =>
                sig_hex <= data1;
                dp      <= dp_vect(1);
                dig     <= "1101";

            when others =>
                sig_hex <= data0;
                dp      <= dp_vect(0);
                dig     <= "1110";

            end case;

            end if;
        end if;

    end process p_mux;
```

### Eight-digit driver

1. Image of the 8-digit driver's block schematic. The image can be drawn on a computer or by hand. Always name all inputs, outputs, components, and internal signals!
